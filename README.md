# 📎 Link Up – How to Install & Test (v2)

Hi! 👋
Thanks for helping me test version 2 of this Chrome extension. It lets you copy your own LinkedIn profile URL with one click — no more digging through menus. Your feedback has helped improve this, and I'd love any more thoughts you have! Read more about the "why" [here](./MOTIVATION.md).

## 🆕 What's New in Version 2:
- Improved accuracy when copying your profile URL — even when you're already on your profile page.
- Cleaned up the link to remove edit and overlay suffixes LinkedIn sometimes adds.
- Renamed the extension to "Link Up" 🎉

---

## 🧩 Step-by-Step Installation - Mac (2 min)
1. Unzip this folder
   - You should see files like manifest.json, popup.html, popup.js, etc.

2. Open Chrome and go to:
   chrome://extensions

3. Turn ON Developer Mode (top-right switch)

4. Click "Load Unpacked"

5. Select the unzipped folder

✅ You should now see the extension appear in your toolbar.

## 🧪 How to Test It
1. Go to https://www.linkedin.com and log in

2. Click the extension icon in the Chrome toolbar

3. Click the "Copy My LinkedIn Profile URL" button in the popup

4. Open Notes, TextEdit, or a message box and paste (⌘ + V)

✅ You should see your clean LinkedIn profile URL (like https://www.linkedin.com/in/your-name)

## 🔐 PRIVACY & SECURITY

This extension was created for personal use and testing purposes only. It does not:

- Store or track any user data
- Send any data to external servers
- Monitor your activity
- Read from your clipboard

It only runs when manually triggered (by clicking the extension icon), and its only function is to find your own LinkedIn profile URL and copy it to your clipboard for easy sharing.

All code is readable and inspectable — feel free to open the files and verify what it does!

---

## ❗ If Something Doesn't Work
- Make sure you're logged into LinkedIn
- Try refreshing the LinkedIn tab
- Check if your profile picture or "Me" menu is visible
- Right-click the popup → click Inspect → go to Console and share any errors with me

Thanks again!
Feel free to give me feedback — anything confusing, broken, or awesome 😄
