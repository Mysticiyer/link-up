🔗 Why I Built Link Up – A Problem Worth Solving

If you're actively applying for jobs or networking on LinkedIn, you're probably doing this at least once a day: hunting for your own profile link just to paste it into a resume, email, or form.

I built Link Up to fix that.

Link Up is a lightweight Chrome extension designed to do one thing well — help users copy their own LinkedIn profile URL instantly, from anywhere on LinkedIn. No digging through menus, no opening your profile, no weird overlay paths or edit-mode links.

🧠 Real People, Real Friction

I conducted a short qualitative survey to understand how job seekers use and share their LinkedIn profiles. Here’s what stood out:

- Every respondent includes their LinkedIn profile on job applications — either in resumes, cover letters, or emails.
- 75% found it at least somewhat difficult to find and share their own profile link, especially on mobile or when multitasking.
- Some had to Google how to find their LinkedIn URL the first time.
- Users wished for a simple “copy link” button on their home or header.
- No one was using external tools — most were just manually navigating to their profile and copying the URL.

🎯 What Link Up Solves

For job seekers, time matters. Mental load matters. Especially when you're filling out forms, applying to dozens of positions, or messaging potential collaborators.

Link Up reduces this friction by making your profile link one click away, always clean, and always ready to paste.

Whether you're:
- On your LinkedIn homepage
- Messaging someone
- Reviewing a job post
- Or even on your own profile

Link Up ensures you always get the clean, public-facing linkedin.com/in/yourname link — no /edit, no /overlay, no noise.

👥 Who It’s For

- Job seekers who frequently include LinkedIn in their outreach
- Students and early career professionals filling out internship forms
- Recruiters or freelancers who need a fast, frictionless way to share their own profile
- Anyone tired of clicking four times just to copy one URL
